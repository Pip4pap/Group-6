A program written in R language called _World Cup analyzer_, takes in FIFA World rankings from a dataset, analyzes, visualises them and predicts how far a team will go in a FIFA World Cup tournament.

**Usage**: Run the app file (WCA.R) in Rstudio (An R IDE)

The visualizations of the dataset are contained in a file called _rankPlot.R_ and the app file prepared is named _WCA.R_.  

Also included in the project files are slides about regression analysis and an example written in R to illustrate regression analysis.
